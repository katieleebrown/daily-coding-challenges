# Daily Coding Challenges
A place to store all of my daily coding challenges

# Why? 
1. I'm a creature of habit and love a good daily puzzle
2. Spaced repetition is a great way to stay sharp
3. I'm always down for some friendly competition

# Codewars Challenges
I'm starting my daily challenges by working through Codewars' Katas. 
Each file has the name of the challenge, my solution, and a link to the codewars challenge to check it out.
